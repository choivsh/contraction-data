FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable MICROFICHE/COPYRIGHT REFERENCE Not Applicable FIELD OF THE INVENTION Certain embodiments of the invention relate to digital video processing. More specifically, certain embodiments of the invention relate to a method and system for adaptive temporal interpolation filtering for motion compensation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A major revolution in video display technology includes flat screens based on either liquid crystal display (LCD) or plasma display panel (PDP) technology that are rapidly replacing the cathode ray tube (CRT) technology that served as the primary display device for more than a half a century. A significant consequence of the new video display technologies is that pictures may now be displayed at higher picture-rates with progressive scanning on a flat screen. The new video display technologies may also facilitate a faster transition from standard definition television (SDTV) to high-definition television (HDTV). However, legacy video compression systems still use formats with lower picture-rates and may be unable to optimally display legacy video on modern display screens. There may be restrictions on channel capacity that may affect the display of low picture-rate pictures. For example, considering a 30 Hz video sequence that may be broadcast over a mobile network, the terminals, for example, mobile phones may receive an encoded video sequence from a server. However, due to bandwidth limitations, only a low bit-rate video sequence may be communicated. As a result, the encoder may remove two out of every three pictures to be transmitted, resulting in a sequence with a picture rate of about 10 Hz, for example. The terminal may be capable of displaying video at 30 Hz but since it receives a 10 Hz video, it may have to perform some form of picture-rate conversion. The available channel capacity may be different in diverse video services. The legacy systems may be different in different regions of the world, for example, NTSC, SECAM or PAL. The picture rate requirements may differ depending on applications and users. Picture-rate conversion may be required in a plurality of applications in order to adapt to a wide variety of display systems. The video picture rate up-conversion may be divided into one or more categories, for example, conversion from interlace to progressive scan or 50/60 Hz interlace to 50/60 Hz progressive, picture rate doubling, for example, 50 Hz to 100 Hz or 60 Hz to 120 Hz, non-integer scan rate conversion, for example, 50 Hz to 60 Hz. An artifact known as "motion judder" may occur when the picture rate of a video sequence is excessively low. Motion judder may occur when the temporal sampling rate is too low to describe motion in a scene. The objects in input pictures may be shifted on either side of a required output picture. A temporal digital filter interpolation method may be used to determine pixel intensity values. The signals describing motion of each of the objects within a scene may be referred to as motion vectors. Each picture or region with the same movement may be allocated a motion vector. The motion estimation system may determine these motion vectors and failing to find a correct motion vector and/or misusing the motion vector in a picture rate converter may lead to noticeable artifacts. When large camera movements occur, regions of a picture close to the borders may have significantly less reliable motion vectors than those closer to the middle and special processing may be required at the picture boundaries. Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with some aspects of the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.

Referring to  1, there is shown a video enabled device 100. The video enabled device 100 may comprise a video processing block 102, a processor 104, a memory 106, an encoder 118 and a data/control bus 108. The video processing block 102 may comprise registers 110 and filter 116. In some instances, the video processing block 102 may also comprise an input buffer 112 and/or an output buffer 114. The video processing block 102 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, and/or code that may be enabled to filter pictures in a video picture or a video picture from a video input stream to reduce noise. For example, video frame pictures may be utilized in video systems with progressive video signals while video field pictures may be utilized in video systems with interlaced video signals. Video fields may alternate parity between top fields and bottom fields. A top field and a bottom field in an interlaced system may be deinterlaced or combined to produce a video frame. The video processing block 102 may be enabled to receive a video input stream and, in some instances, to buffer at least a portion of the received video input stream in the input buffer 112. In this regard, the input buffer 112 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, and/or code that may be enabled to store at least a portion of the received video input stream. Similarly, the video processing block 102 may be enabled to generate a filtered video output stream to a video decoder and, in some instances, to buffer at least a portion of the generated filtered video output stream in the output buffer 114. In this regard, the output buffer 114 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, and/or code that may be enabled to store at least a portion of the filtered video output stream. The filter 116 in the video processing block 102 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, and/or code that may be enabled to perform filtering operation with noise reduction on the current picture. In this regard, the filter 116 may be enabled to operate in a plurality of filtering modes, where each filtering mode may be associated with one of a plurality of supported filtering operations. The filter 116 may utilize video content, filter coefficients, threshold levels, and/or constants to generate the filtered video output stream in accordance with the filtering mode selected. In this regard, the video processing block 102 may generate blending factors to be utilized with the appropriate filtering mode selected. The registers 110 in the video processing block 102 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, and/or code that may be enabled to store information that corresponds to filter coefficients, threshold levels, and/or constants, for example. Moreover, the registers 110 may be enabled to store information that corresponds to a selected filtering mode. The processor 104 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, and/or code that may be enabled to process data and/or perform system control operations. The processor 104 may be enabled to control at least a portion of the operations of the video processing block 102. For example, the processor 104 may generate at least one signal to control the selection of the filtering mode in the video processing block 102. Moreover, the processor 104 may be enabled to program, update, and/or modify filter coefficients, threshold levels, and/or constants in at least a portion of the registers 110. For example, the processor 104 may generate at least one signal to retrieve stored filter coefficients, threshold levels, and/or constants that may be stored in the memory 106 and transfer the retrieved information to the registers 110 via the data/control bus 108. The memory 106 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, and/or code that may be enabled to store information that may be utilized by the video processing block 102 to reduce noise in the video input stream. The memory 106 may be enabled to store filter coefficients, threshold levels, and/or constants, for example, to be utilized by the video processing block 102. The encoder 118 may be enabled to receive and process a plurality of statistical inputs from the processor 104 and the video processing block 102. The encoder 118 may be enabled to generate the encoded compressed video stream based on encoding the filtered video output stream. In operation, the processor 104 may select a filtering mode of operation and may program the selected filtering mode into the registers 110 in the video processing block 102. Moreover, the processor 104 may program the appropriate values for the filter coefficients, threshold levels, and/or constants into the registers 110 in accordance with the selected filtering mode. The video processing block 102 may receive the video input stream and may filter pictures in a video picture in accordance with the selected filtering mode. In some instances, the video input stream may be stored in the input buffer 112 before processing. The video processing block 102 may generate the appropriate blending factors needed to perform the noise reduction filtering operation selected by the processor 104. The video processing block 102 may generate the filtered video output stream after performing the noise reduction filtering operation. In some instances, the filtered video output stream may be stored in the output buffer 114 before being transferred out of the video processing block 102. The processor 104 may determine the mode of operation of various portions of the video processing block 102. For example, the processor 104 may configure data registers in the video processing block 102 to allow direct memory access (DMA) transfers of video data to the memory 106. The processor 104 may also communicate instructions to an image sensor to initiate capturing of images. The memory 106 may be used to store image data that may be processed and communicated by the processor 104. The memory 106 may also be used for storing code and/or data that may be used by the processor 104. The memory 106 may also be used to store data for other functionalities of the video processing block 102. For example, the memory 106 may store data corresponding to voice communication. The processor 104 may comprise a state machine that may enable determination of whether video data type is interlaced type or progressive type. The processor 104 may be enabled to compute a plurality of weights for adaptively adjusting one or more parameters of the linear filter 116 utilized for motion compensation. In instances where two frames are utilized for motion estimation of a video sequence, the video processing block 102 may be enabled to combine the motion compensated pictures of a previous frame and a current frame to adaptively compute a plurality of subsequent weights. In instances where three or more frames are utilized for motion estimation of a video sequence, the video processing block 102 may be enabled to extract a desired picture from the video sequence and combine one or more motion compensated output pictures with the extracted desired picture from the video sequence to adaptively compute a plurality of subsequent weights.  2 is a diagram illustrating exemplary consecutive video frames, in connection with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to  2, there is shown a current video frame 204, a previous video frame 202, and a next video frame 206.

Referring to  3A, there is shown a plurality of source film frames A 302, B, 304, C 306 and D 308 and a plurality of corresponding progressive scan 3:2 video frames A 302.sub.1 in phase 3, A 302.sub.2 in phase 4, A 302.sub.3 in phase 0, B 304.sub.1 in phase 1, B 304.sub.2 in phase 2, C 306.sub.1 in phase 3, C 306.sub.2 in phase 4, C 306.sub.3 in phase 0, D 308.sub.1 in phase 1 and D 308.sub.2 in phase 2. Notwithstanding, the words pixel and picture may be utilized interchangeably throughout this disclosure, without limiting the scope of the invention. The video enabled device 100 may be enabled to determine a cadence, for example, 3:2 pulldown and a phase of the received progressive input frames A 302, B, 304, C 306 and D 308. The video enabled device 100 may be enabled to determine a difference between two or more consecutive received progressive input frames, for example, A 302 and B, 304. The video enabled device 100 may be enabled to compensate for 24 Hz video in a NTSC source.  3B is a diagram illustrating exemplary 2:2 pulldown that may be utilized for displaying 30 Hz video at 60 Hz or 25 Hz video at 50 Hz, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to  3B, there is shown a plurality of source frames A 352, B, 354, C 356 and D 358 and a plurality of corresponding progressive scan 2:2 video frames A 352.sub.1 in phase 0, A 352.sub.2 in phase 1, B 354.sub.1 in phase 0, B 354.sub.2 in phase 1, C 356.sub.1 in phase 0, C 356.sub.2 in phase 1, D 358.sub.1 in phase 0 and D 358.sub.2 in phase 1.

Referring to  4A, there is shown a plurality of coded pictures, for example, P1 402 and P2 404 and the location of an interpolated picture 406. For example, the interpolated picture 406 may be inserted k time units from the coded picture P1 402.  4B is a block diagram illustrating exemplary motion vectors of an interpolated picture, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to  4B, there is shown a plurality of coded pictures, for example, P1 452 and P2 454 and an interpolated picture 456. For example, the interpolated picture 456 may be inserted k time units from the coded picture P1 452. A motion vector 458 may point from an area in the previous picture P1 452 to an area in the next picture P2 454, in such a way that the motion vector 458 may capture the motion that occurred between the two original pictures P1 452 and P2 454. The motion vector 460 may be a shifted version of motion vector 458. The motion vector 460 may be shifted to align with the interpolated picture 456. The motion vector 460 may be split into two motion vectors, for example, the motion vectors MV1 462 and MV2 464. Each of the estimated motion vectors, for example, motion vector 460 may be split and scaled for motion compensated interpolation. The directions of the two scaled motion vectors, for example, the motion vectors MV1 462 and MV2 464 may be opposite to each other. The length of the scaled motion vector, for example, the motion vector MV1 462 may be proportional to the temporal difference between the interpolated picture 456 and the original picture P1 452. The length of the scaled motion vector, for example, the motion vector MV2 464 may be proportional to the temporal difference between the interpolated picture 456 and the original picture P2 454.  5 is a block diagram illustrating exemplary motion-compensated forward and backward motion vectors corresponding to a block using adjacent pictures, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to  5, there is shown a plurality of pictures, for example, P1 502 and P2 504 and an interpolated picture 506. The block motion estimation block 302 may be enabled to perform bi-directional motion estimation and select the motion vector with the least cost measurement for a given block or picture position (x,y). The selected forward motion vector 458 may be forward and backward projected onto the adjacent pictures P1 502 and P2 504 using a fraction value fract=k to generate a plurality of motion vectors in sub-pel resolution. For example, the motion vector MV2 510 may be generated according to the following equations: mv2.sub.--x=(1-k)*fwd.sub.--mv.sub.--x and mv2.sub.--y=(1-k)*fwd.sub.--mv.sub.--y, where fwd_mv_x and fwd_mv_y may represent x and y components of the selected forward motion vector 458 respectively. Similarly, the motion vector MV1 508 may be generated according to the following equations: mv1.sub.--x=mv2.sub.--x-fwd.sub.--mv.sub.--x and mv1.sub.--y=mv2.sub.--y-fwd.sub.--mv.sub.--y. The motion compensated interpolation block 308 may be enabled to perform motion compensation at each picture location. The current picture (x,y) may be indicated by picture X 512 in the interpolated picture 506. The picture A 514 may indicate a non-motion compensated picture from the previous picture P1 502. The picture B 516 may indicate a non-motion compensated picture from the next picture P2 504. The picture C 518 may indicate the motion compensated picture with sub-pixel resolution from the previous picture P1 502. The picture C 518 may be represented as follows: PIX.sub.--C=P1(x+mv1.sub.--x,y+mv1.sub.--y) where mv1_x and mv1_y may indicate x and y components of MV1 508. The picture D 520 may indicate the motion compensated picture with sub-pixel resolution from the next picture P2 504. The picture D 520 may be represented as follows: PIX.sub.--D=P2(x+mv2.sub.--x,y+mv2.sub.--y) where mv2_x and mv2_y may indicate x and y components of MV2 510. The picture X 512 may be generated at the boundary regions using one of picture C 518 and picture D 520. If the forward motion vector 458 is selected, the picture D 520 may be used for predicting picture X 512. If the backward motion vector 408 is selected, the picture C 518 may be used for predicting picture X 512.  6A is a block diagram of an exemplary linear FIR filter, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.

For example, the vector median filter 714 may be enabled to receive an input from each of the 4-point FIR linear filters, the FIR-1 702, the FIR-2 704 and the FIR-3 706 and generate a vector median output to FMH-3 705. The plurality of vector median filters, for example, the vector median filters 714, 716 and 724 may be 3-point vector median filters and comprise a plurality of filter coefficients w.sub.1, w.sub.2, w.sub.3 and w.sub.4, and a summer. The structure of a 3-point vector median filter may be substantially as described with respect to  6B. In the second stage of the adaptive temporal interpolation filtering system 700, each 4-point linear FIR filter, for example, the FIR-1 718, the FIR-2 720 and the FIR-3 722 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry and/or code that may be enabled to receive at least four inputs, such as, outputs of vector median filters 714 and 716, and outputs of the linear FIR filters, FIR-3 706 and FIR-1 708 and generate an output to the vector median filter 724 in FMH-3 705.

For example, the vector median filter 724 may be enabled to receive an input from each of the 4-point FIR linear filters, FIR-1 718, FIR-2 720 and FIR-3 722 and generate a desired vector median output, such as picture X, PIX_X. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, for each linear FIR filter in each FMH filter, the coefficients w.sub.1, w.sub.2, w.sub.3 and w.sub.4 may be programmable and may be utilized to adaptively tune the overall filter operation. The coefficient values of w.sub.1, w.sub.2, w.sub.3 and w.sub.4 are between 0 and 1. Accordingly, the two-stage adaptive temporal interpolation filtering system 700 may be configured based on a plurality of filtering modes. For example, Table 1 illustrates a static configuration of the two-stage adaptive temporal interpolation filtering system 700, which may be referred to as the stationary linear filtering path. TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 FIR-1 FIR-2 FIR-3 w1 w2 w3 w4 w1 w2 w3 w4 w1 w2 w3 w4 FMH-1 x x x x x x x x 1-k k 0 0 FMH-2 1-k k 0 0 x x x x x x x x FMH-3 0 1 0 0 x x x x 0 0 1 0 Table 2 illustrates another static configuration of the two-stage adaptive temporal interpolation filtering system 700, which may be referred to as the motion linear filtering path, for example. TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 FIR-1 FIR-2 FIR-3 w1 w2 w3 w4 w1 w2 w3 w4 w1 w2 w3 w4 FMH-1 x x x x x x x x 0 0 1-k k FMH-2 0 0 1-k k x x x x x x x x FMH-3 0 1 0 0 x x x x 0 0 1 0 Table 3 illustrates another static configuration of the two-stage adaptive temporal interpolation filtering system 700, which may be referred to as the stationary FMH filtering path, for example.

If no motion has occurred at this location, PIX_A and PIX_B may be nearly identical, and the output may be a stationary picture. If motion has occurred, PIX_A and PIX_B may likely be quite different relative to the motion compensated pictures. Accordingly, the output may be either the motion compensated result or the stationary picture which is closest to the motion compensated result. Table 4 illustrates another static configuration of the two-stage adaptive temporal interpolation filtering system 700, which may be referred to as the motion FMH filtering path, for example. TABLE-US-00004 TABLE 4 FIR-1 FIR-2 FIR-3 w1 w2 w3 w4 w1 w2 w3 w4 w1 w2 w3 w4 FMH-1 1-k k 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 FMH-2 1-k k 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 FMH-3 1 0 0 0 x x x x 0 0 0 1 The FMH-3 filter 705 in Table 4 may be enabled to check the consistency between the two motion-compensated pictures, PIX_C and PIX_D. If the motion estimation for this block has accurately determined the motion of the current picture, PIX_C and PIX_D may be close to one another. Therefore, the output may be one of the motion compensated pictures. If motion estimation has failed, PIX_C and PIX_D may likely be quite different relative to the stationary average. Table 5 illustrates another static configuration of the two-stage adaptive temporal interpolation filtering system 700, which may be referred to as the stationary/motion linear blend filtering path, for example. TABLE-US-00005 TABLE 5 FIR-1 FIR-2 FIR-3 w1 w2 w3 w4 w1 w2 w3 w4 w1 w2 w3 w4 FMH-1 x x x x x x x x 1-k k 0 0 FMH-2 0 0 1-k k x x x x x x x x FMH-3 0 1-p p 0 0 1-p p 0 0 1-p p 0 The weighted average blends together the motion compensated average with the stationary average. This blending may be controlled by the programmable coefficient p in FMH-3 of Table 5. The coefficient p may be utilized to bias the final vector median filter 724 either towards motion-compensated filtering or towards stationary filtering. The coefficient p may be set to a particular value by a user or may be programmed on a frame-by-frame or block-by-block basis. For example, the coefficient p may be programmed based on a measure of motion vector consistency. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the final vector median filter 724 may be enabled to perform a vector median operation on the stationary FMH filtering output, the motion FMH filtering output, and the stationary/motion linear blend output, for example. The final vector median filter 724 may be enabled to remove outlying pictures by finding an input picture similar to the other two inputs. The stationary/motion linear blend input may be tuned with the adjustable parameter p in FMH-3 705 of Table 5 to bias towards either stationary or motion-compensated filtering, as shown in Table 6. Table 6 illustrates an exemplary static configuration of the two-stage adaptive temporal interpolation filtering system 700, which may be referred to as the stationary/motion linear blend filtering path, for example.

The vector median filter 1224 may be enabled to vector median filter each of the generated plurality of linear filtered output pictures to generate one or more motion compensated output pictures, PIX_X(n) 1260. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, FMH-3 1205 may be dynamically configured.

In step 1310, the generated plurality of filtered input pictures may be filtered by a plurality of linear filters. In step 1312, the outputs of the linear filters may be vector median filtered to generate one or more motion compensated output pictures, PIX_X(n). In step 1314, it may be determined whether only two frames are available for motion estimation of a video sequence. In instances where only two frames are available for motion estimation of a video sequence, control passes to step 1316.

In step 1318, the motion compensated pictures, P(x+fmv.sub.x, y+fmv.sub.y; n-1) 1256 and P(x+bmv.sub.x, y+bmv.sub.y; n) 1258 may be combined to generate an error signal. In step 1320, an adaptive algorithm may be utilized to generate a plurality of subsequent weights, for example, w.sub.1, w.sub.2, w.sub.3 and w.sub.4, based on the generated error signal. In step 1322, the generated plurality of subsequent weights, for example, w.sub.1, w.sub.2, w.sub.3 and w.sub.4, may be utilized to adaptively adjust one or more parameters of a plurality of linear filters. Control then returns to step 1310. In instances where three or more frames are available for motion estimation of a video sequence, control passes to step 1324. In step 1324, a desired picture, PIX_Y(n) may be extracted from the video sequence. In step 1326, the generated one or more motion compensated output pictures, PIX_X(n) and the extracted desired picture, PIX_Y(n) may be combined to generate an error signal.
