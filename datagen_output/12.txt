TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a system and method for wireless communications, and, in particular embodiments, to systems and methods for sectorized transmission in a wireless network. BACKGROUND In wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks, mobile stations (STAs) accessing the uplink communications channel employ a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) technique to avoid collisions with other STAs accessing the uplink channel. More specifically, a STA will verify that the uplink channel is idle before performing an uplink transmission, which tends to reduce collisions, where two STAs are transmitting at the same time. This CSMA/CA technique works relatively well when STAs utilize moderate to high transmit power in mid-to-small sized wireless local area networks (WLANs), e.g., radius less than fifty meters, as STAs are typically able detect one another's uplink transmissions, and thereby avoid transmissions that will result in a collision. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Technical advantages are generally achieved, by embodiments of this disclosure which describe systems and methods for sectorized transmission in a wireless network. In accordance with an embodiment, a method for scheduling in a wireless network is provided. In this example, the method includes scheduling transmissions for multiple groups of mobile stations (STAs) in a multi-sector coverage area. Groups of STAs positioned in different sectors of the multi-sector coverage area are scheduled to perform transmissions during different time periods. The method further includes transmitting a first signal to a first group of STAs positioned in a first sector of the multi-sector coverage area. The first signal indicates that the first group of STAs is scheduled to perform transmissions during a first time period. The first time period is different from a second time period during which a second group of STAs is scheduled to perform transmissions. An apparatus configured to perform this method is also provided.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The making and using of embodiments of this disclosure are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the concepts disclosed herein can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts, and that the specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative and do not serve to limit the scope of the claims. Further, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure as defined by the appended claims. The above discussed CSMA/CA techniques may be less effective in larger WLANs (e.g., radius exceeding fifty meters) and/or when STAs typically use low transmit power, as STAs may often be unable to detect one another's transmissions. More specifically, a hidden node problem (as discussed in greater detail below in reference to  2) occurs when two or more STAs located outside of one another's carrier range perform simultaneous transmissions to a centrally located base station, thereby resulting in a collision. The hidden node problem is a significant concern for next generation Wi-Fi networks, some of which are likely to include large cells as well as high numbers of low transmit power STAs. For instance, Institute of Electrical and Electronics (IEEE) 802.11ah is a next-generation Wi-Fi standard for smart sensors and metering, and will likely be implemented in WLANs having a radius of up to one kilometer and housing high numbers of low transmit-power sensor devices. Accordingly, mechanisms for addressing the hidden node problem in Wi-Fi networks is desired. Aspects of this disclosure avoid the hidden node problem by scheduling transmissions in different sectors during different time periods. More specifically, STAs in the same sector are more likely to be within one another transmission range, and are therefore more likely to detect one another's carrier transmissions. As a result, scheduling STAs in different sectors to transmit during different time periods may significantly reduce collisions resulting from the hidden node problem. Scheduling of sectors is communicated to sectors via transmission of beamformed beacon signals at the beginning of respective time periods. For instance, a first beamformed beacon signal may be transmitted to STAs in a first sector at the beginning of a first time period, while a second beamformed beacon signal may be transmitted to STAs in a second sector at the beginning of a second time period.  1 illustrates a network 100 for communicating data. The network 100 comprises an access point (AP) 110 having a coverage area 112, a plurality of STAs 120, and a backhaul network 130. The AP 110 may comprise any component capable of providing wireless access by, inter alia, establishing uplink (dashed line) and/or downlink (dotted line) connections with the STAs 120. The AP 110 can also be referred as a base station, an enhanced base station (eNB), a femtocell, a controller and other wirelessly enabled devices. The STAs 120 may comprise any component capable of establishing a wireless connection with the AP 110. The STA 120 can be referred as a user equipment, a mobile station, or any other wireless devices. The backhaul network 130 may be any component or collection of components that allow data to be exchanged between the AP 110 and a remote end (not shown). In some embodiments, the network 100 may comprise various other wireless devices, such as relays, femtocells, etc. A hidden node problem may occur when transmitters employing CSMA/CA transmission techniques are outside of one another's transmission range.  2 illustrates a hidden node problem in a communications network 200. As shown, the network 200 includes a base station 210 having a serving cell 202, a transmitter 221 having a transmission range 232, and a transmitter 222 having a transmission range 232. As shown, the transmitters 221-222 are positioned within the cell 202, and therefore may attempt to perform transmissions to the base station 210 in accordance with a CSMA/CA transmission technique. However, since the STA 221 is outside the transmission range 232 of the STA 222, the STA 221 may be unable to detect carrier signals of the STA 222. Likewise, because the STA 222 is outside the transmission range 231 of the STA 221, the STA 222 may be unable to detect carrier signals of the STA 221. As such, the STAs 221-222 may perform sequential (or overlapping) transmissions that collide or are otherwise decodable by the base station 210. Such a situation may often be referred to as the hidden node problem. Aspects of this disclosure avoid the hidden node problem by scheduling transmissions sector by sector. While the transmissions of this disclosure are often discussed in the context of "uplink transmissions," aspects of this disclosure are applicable to any transmission from a STA or other wireless device, e.g., direct transmissions, device-to-device (D2D) transmissions, etc.  3 illustrates a network 300 configured for sectorized transmissions. The network 300 includes a base station 310 having a serving cell 302, which is divided into a plurality of sectors 311-313 each of which housing a respective one of the STAs 321-323. In embodiments, collisions resulting from the hidden node problem may be avoided in the network 300 by scheduling each of the sectors 311, 312, and 313 to perform transmissions at different times. For instance, the sector 311 may be scheduled for transmission during a first period, the sector 312 may be scheduled for transmission during a second period, and the sector 313 may be scheduled for transmission during a third period. In some embodiments, scheduling of the transmissions may be achieved through broadcasting a beacon signal at the beginning of a respective period. For instance, the base station 310 may transmit a first beacon signal to mobile stations in the sector 311 to initialize the first period. After expiration of the first period, the base station may transmit a second beacon signal to mobile stations in the sector 312 to initialize the second period. Following expiration of the second period, the base station may transmit a third beacon signal to mobile stations in the sector 313 to initialize the third period. The first beacon may be a beamformed signal directed at spatial locations within the sector 311, the second beacon may be a beamformed signal directed at spatial locations within the sector 312, and the third beacon may be a beamformed signal directed at spatial locations within the sector 313.  4 illustrates a method 400 for scheduling transmissions, as might be performed by a base station. The method 400 begins at step 410, where the base station schedules a first sector for transmissions during a first period. Thereafter, the method 400 proceeds to step 420, where the base station transmits a beacon to STAs located in the first sector at the beginning of the first period. Next, the method 400 proceeds to step 430, where the base station schedules the next sector for transmission during next period. Subsequently, the method 400 proceeds to step 440, where the base station transmits a beacon to STAs in the next sector at the beginning of the next period. Next, the method 400 proceeds to step 450, where it is determined whether additional sectors need to be scheduled. If so, the method 400 reverts back to step 430, where the next sector is scheduled for transmission. Otherwise, the method 400 reverts back to step 410, where the first sector is once again scheduled.  5 illustrates a method 500 for performing transmissions, as might be performed by a STA. The method 500 begins at step 510, where the STA detects a beacon signal at a beginning of a period. Next the method 500 proceeds to step 520, where the STA performs transmission during the period. In embodiments, the STA may perform transmissions in accordance with CSMA/CA. In some examples, the beacon may include a scheduling indicator that is selectively directed a certain group of STAs within a sector. For instance, the beacon's scheduling indicator may specify a group number, traffic type, traffic class, or some other characteristic associated with the group of STAs. In one embodiment, the beacon may schedule STAs having high SNRs (e.g., cell-center STA) without scheduling STAs having low SNRs (e.g., cell-edge STAs) by encoding the scheduling indicator at a rate that is decodable only by STAs having an SNR exceeding a certain level or threshold.  6 illustrates a network 600 configured for sectorized transmissions. The network 600 includes a base station 610 having a serving cell 602, which is divided into a plurality of sectors 611-613 housing a plurality of STAs 622, 623, and 633. Notably, the sector 612 houses a STA 622 positioned near the center of the cell 602, and a cell 632 positioned near the edge of the cell 602. Due to their relative positions to the base station 610, the STA 622 may have a higher SNR than the STA 632. In some implementations, it may be desirable to schedule the STA 622 without scheduling the STA 632. In such a case, the base station 610 may transmit a beacon comprising a scheduling indicator that is encoded at a coding rate such that the scheduling indicator is decodable by the STA 622, but not by the STA 632. In some embodiments, the scheduling of STAs is performed in accordance with a channel quality criteria. For instance, scheduling may be performed in accordance with a received signal strength indication (RSSI) or a signal to interference ratio (SINR) of a beacon signal. In one embodiment, the beacon contains an information 7element that specifies schedules for STAs having various levels and/or ranges of channel quality, e.g., RSSI, SINR, or otherwise. For instance, an AP may schedule STAs having different signal strengths or signal qualities to different time intervals. As an example, an AP may schedule STAs having channel quality that is less than a threshold to a first time interval, while scheduling STAs having channel quality equal to or exceeding the threshold to a second time interval. Indeed, the AP may schedule based on ranges of channel quality such that STAs having a channel quality within a certain range (e.g., first range, second range, third range, etc.) are scheduled to transmit during a respective interval. In some embodiments, STAs having a channel quality that exceeds a threshold may be permitted to transmit during any interval, while STAs having lower channel qualities may be limited to certain intervals. Scheduling information (e.g., time intervals, channel quality thesholds/ranges, etc.) may be specified in the beacon, during association, in a probe response during discovery. Additionally, at least some of the scheduling information may be a priori information. In accordance with the above discussed aspects of this disclosure, different stations located at different distances can be scheduled for different durations, which may achieve improved fairness and/or network performance (e.g., fewer hidden node collisions). Scheduling in accordance with channel quality may be combined with other scheduling strategies. For instance, scheduling may be performed in accordance with channel quality as well as another criteria (e.g., sector location, group number, traffic type, device type, etc.) to achieve diverse scheduling arrangements. In an embodiment, a receiving STA measures a signal strength received in a signal (e.g., beacon or otherwise), and then compares the signal strength value with the channel quality thresholds (e.g., indicated by the beacon, or otherwise) to determine which time interval to transmit, receive, sleep, etc. In the current IEEE 802.11 standards, channel access is based on a CSMA/CA method, where each station listens to the channel prior to transmission. However, when stations (STAs) are located in different areas and are out of the carrier sensing range of each other, e.g., STA1 and STA2 in  7 cannot hear each other, and thus are likely to transmit to the access point (AP) at the same time, which causes collisions. This is generally known as the hidden node problem. Collisions due to the hidden node problem will result in packet losses and retransmissions, which degrade the channel utilization and the quality of service (QoS) of users. In an IEEE 802.11ah network where sensors use very low power to transmit over a long distance, it is expected that hidden node problem could be more severe as the low transmission power and high path loss make it more difficult for STAs to detect the ongoing transmissions of sensors. Mitigating the hidden node problem generally should improve the performance of an 802.11ah network. One way to reduce collisions among bursty channel accesses of a large number of users is to group STAs and allow different groups of STAs to access the channel during different time periods. There are different ways to group users. For example, user grouping can be based on the MAC address of users, or based on the types of applications or QoS requirements of users. Grouping is helpful to reduce the number of contending STAs, and thus is efficient to improve the network resource utilization. However, such grouping approaches are not specifically designed to mitigate the hidden node problem. For an IEEE 802.11ah network that consists of both high power offloading STAs and low power sensors/smart meters, it is recognized that low power sensors are more likely hidden from other STAs and failed in contentions. One way to alleviate the unfair channel access between high power users and low power sensors is to divide STAs into two groups with different power levels. And high power and low power STAs should contend in different time periods. This approach can eliminate the collisions between high power STAs and low power STAs. However, contentions between high power STAs and between low power STAs still exist, and low power sensors suffer from hidden node problem as before. In addition, it is critical to determine the time periods reserved for high/low power STAs, especially when the number of offloading STAs may change over time. An inappropriate setting of time periods generally will degrade the network performance. An embodiment uses sectorized channel access to alleviate the hidden node problem in 802.11 networks. Embodiments may be applied to Wi-Fi networks and devices, such as Wi-Fi access points (APs) and Wi-Fi stations (STAs). Sectorization is a method used in cellular systems to reduce interference. However, in a cellular system the users are allowed to access the base station continuously. In contrast, in an embodiment a user can send/receive only during the sector contention duration, which is signaled in the sector beacon. Further, an embodiment allows sectors to be dynamically adjusted, rotated in space and in time to minimize the collisions and interference. A simple way of efficient sectorized channel access is shown in  8. The AP first broadcasts a beacon to the STAs in the first sector. Upon receiving the beacon with the sector information, STAs in the first sector contend for channel access in the following sector contention period. After that, the AP switches to another sector, and broadcasts a beacon so that STAs in that sector can contend for channel access in the following time period. The AP can switch between sectors in a round robin manner or in other deterministic or random sequences. The AP also can record the STAs associated in each sector and use this information for Traffic Information Map signaling of downlink traffic if needed. It is also possible that some STAs may hear multiple beacons in different sectors. In this case, the STAs can select one sector to associate with, e.g., select the sector with a higher received signal strength indicator (RSSI). When a STA observes a decreased RSSI in one sector and decides to switch to another sector with a higher RSSI, the STA may or may not update with the AP. A station may or may not inform the AP about the change of its sector via management frames. A STA may provide feedback to the AP with the sector ID. The feedback may indicate received channel quality, e.g., a signal strength of the received beacon. The AP may then use the feedback information for various scheduling or other purposes. For instance, the AP may use the feedback information to schedule transmissions (downlink, uplink, or otherwise), to determine the STA location (with various degrees of precision), to schedule direct link communications between two stations in the same sector or between stations in different sectors. The feedback information may also be used to adjust sector size for load balancing or group sizes for load balancing. In an embodiment, one or more stations may be allowed to transmit at any time (e.g., by default) irrespective of the sector. For instance, stations belonging to a certain group (e.g., group ID 0) may be permitted to transmit at any time by default, which may allow those stations to transmit prior to association. The default group of stations may be changed during association, which may allow the network administrator to restrict transmission by some stations in sectors reserved for a specific group. In an embodiment, the association can be implemented as follows. A STA that comes into the AP coverage is waiting to receive a beacon. The beacon carries information about the BSS ID, the sector index, the duration of the sector contention period as well as the period until the next beacon occurrence. When a STA receives a beacon it can decide to associate to the AP using that sector index. In the period following the beacon reception the STA can contend to the channel access as long as the message does not pass beyond the sector contention duration. In the association process the AP respond to a STA in the contention period of the same sector. The association ID (AID) allocated to the STA could be selected from a set of AIDs dedicated to that particular sector or from a pool of AIDs called nomadic AIDs, which are dedicated to STAs that frequently change their location. The AIDs are used to identify STAs for the downlink traffic. The AP uses a Traffic Information Map (TIM) to signal which AID index has traffic in the following sector interval. If the STA is associated with a nomadic AID its information for downlink traffic could be broadcast in all beacons. In another embodiment, the TIM map is identical in all beacons, i.e. AIDs are not necessarily associated with a particular sector. However in an alternative embodiment a learning algorithm can be used to map AIDs to particular sectors, thus minimizing the TIM size. For instance, after many replies received from a STA in a particular sector that STA can be associated only with that sector. Later, if one reply or more replies are not received in that particular sector from that particular STA for a paging message, the STA can be paged (via TIM map) in all sectors and declared nomadic. In a different embodiment, a STA can associate itself as fixed (not mobile), which means that the STA will remain for long time in that sector. There are several methods for management of the STAs' sector status. In one method the AP maintains a STA's sector status via association or sector switch procedure, i.e., during the association procedure, the STA and AP negotiate a sector for the STA, and after the association, if the STA switches to another sector, it performs a sector switch and lets the AP know of the switching. In another method the AP doesn't maintain a STA's sector status. When a STA wants to get data from the AP, it sends a message (e.g. PS-poll) to the AP, and the message includes an indicator of the sector. The AP gets the sector indicator and sends data to the STA if there is any data pending for it. In another embodiment the sector size and duration are variable. A STA is aware about the next period of time it is allowed to transmit or receive data via the beacon information of sector contention duration as well as the next beacon occurrence. The AP can dynamically rotate or adjust the size and duration of sectors in order to minimize the hidden node problem. The TIM map can be broadcast in all beacons. A STA would dynamically select its own sector based on the RSSI level. Another embodiment allows the AP to broadcast a beacon to all or multiple sectors before each contention period. As shown in  9, the AP can transmit beacons in different sectors in a sequence to inform STAs of the current active sector for channel access. Upon receiving the beacons, STAs in the active sector contend for channel access while STAs in other sectors can go to sleep until their associated sector becomes active for channel access. This embodiment generally is more energy efficient for low duty cycle sensors at the cost of more beacons broadcast in multiple sectors. To further reduce the beacon overhead, another embodiment is to broadcast beacons in multiple sectors once, followed by contention periods for STAs in different sectors, as shown in  10. This embodiment generally strikes a tradeoff between the energy efficiency and overhead reduction. A different embodiment uses two types of beacons such omni beacons and sector beacons. . 11-12 illustrate sectorized channel access including an omni beacon. A sector beacon contains the data to access a particular sector as well as the TIM for fixed stations associated with that sector and nomadic stations not associated with a fixed sector. An omni beacon is transmitted periodically after all sectors are parsed. The time division between two omni beacons can contain a sectorized time interval when the channel access is done via the sector access method as described above, and non-sectorized access when all the stations can compete for the channel access irrespective of their location. An optional omni beacon can be broadcast to mark the beginning of non-sectorized time interval when all the STA could access the channel. The various embodiments can be combined with other methods of channel access as well. For example, the contention period in a single sector can be divided between low and high power nodes, etc. In an embodiment, beacons may be transmitted consecutively at designated intervals, e.g., intervals designated data transmission in various sectors. For instance, transmission of a first beacon for a first sector may be followed by transmission of a second beacon for a second sector, which may be followed by transmission of an omni-directional beacon (e.g., for all sectors in the cell). This consecutive sequence of beacons (e.g., first beacon, second beacon, omni-directional beacon) may be repeated. There are several possible methods to implement sectorization. In an IEEE 802.11 network, the access point can employ multiple antenna elements, e.g., a sectorized antenna with fixed beamwidth and directions, or an adaptive array antenna that can adaptively adjust the beamwidth towards the desirable directions. Without loss of generality, consider the AP uses a directional antenna and communication with STAs within its beamwidth; the AP rotates the directions in a sequence to communicate with all STAs in the network. In an embodiment, the sectorized beacon can be identified by a bit or a sequence of bits in the PHY preamble (signal (SIG) field) or in the MAC header or in a data payload of the beacon. Another way to identify the sectorized beacon is a particular rotation of the constellation such quadrature binary phase shift keying (QBPSK). In another embodiment, when an AP receives an association request or a probe request it can respond with a probe response that specifies the sector where the sender belongs to. For instance the AP can use an antenna array to identify the direction of the incoming probe request, and then it can reply with a probe response, which contains an index or type of identification of the sector. In another embodiment the sector information can be asked by a STA at any time via an explicit message or a message piggy-backed on other message. The AP can then either send the sector information via a unicast message to the requester, or collect several requests and send the information via a broadcast message that identifies the station and the sector index the sector belongs to. More generally, an embodiment allows channel access in a particular space region at particular time for a particular duration. This method can be associated with other sleep/power save schedule methods. In another embodiment, several APs exchange information about their scheduling in different space zones such that the interference can be minimized via a distributed or a centralized method.  13 is a block diagram of a processing system that may be used for implementing the devices and methods disclosed herein.
