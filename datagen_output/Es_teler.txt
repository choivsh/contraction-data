Es Teler is an Indonesian fruit cocktail. Avocado, coconut meat, cincau, jackfruit and other fruits are served with coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, Pandanus amaryllifolius leaf (normally in the form of cocopandan syrup), sugar, and a tiny amount of salt.
This concoction, created by Murniati Widjaja, won a competition to come up with a national drink for Indonesia in 1982.
