Mobile multi-hop relay (MMR) network is known to be easy to install and convenient to , a fading phenomenon due to multi-path, inter-symbol interference (ISI), and the Doppler Effect resulting from the mobility of a user equipment. A variety of techniques are being developed in order to overcome the abnormal characteristics of the wireless channel and to increase the reliability of wireless communication. Meanwhile, with the employment of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and with the introduction and distribution of various devices such as a smart phone, a table personal computer (PC), etc., a data requirement size for a cellular network is increased rapidly. To satisfy a high data requirement size, various techniques are under development. A carrier aggregation (CA) technique, a cognitive radio (CR) technique, or the like for effectively using more frequency bands are under research. In addition, a multiple antenna technique, a multiple base station cooperation technique, or the like for increasing data   manage because of its self-organizing and self-healing characteristics. However, MMR is vulnerable to security problems because of the same reason. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid authentication and key distribution algorithm for IEEE 802.16j MMR service. The proposed scheme uses centralized authentication when a mobile station or a relay station initially joins the MMR network and uses distributed authentication for hop-by-hop authentication between mobile nodes. We examine the procedure of the proposed scheme and its usefulness when applied to MMR networks. We also analyze the performance of the hybrid scheme. The proposed scheme can be used in any mobile multi-hop network as well as IEEE 802.16j MMR network.
